**SOURCE:**

|Listname|URL|
|--|--|
|blacklist.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xlimit91/xlimit91-block-list/master/blacklist.txt|
|regex.list|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xlimit91/xlimit91-block-list/master/regex.list|

**INFO/CHANGELOG:**

I will try to keep it up-to-date regularly.

- Added blacklist and regex.list seperately.
- List.txt Â» This list was my first version. It will probably not receive any new updates, or at least at longer intervals. List.txt will stay online, because some may still use it
