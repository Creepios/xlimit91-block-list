# xlimit91-block-list for Pi-Hole
Handpicked custom block list annoying ads, trackers, scam sites etc. for Pi-Hole.

You can add the list to your adblock or Pi-Hole if you want. I will try to keep it up2date regularly.
- Added blacklist and regex.list seperately.
- List.txt » This list will probably not receive any new updates, or at least at longer intervals. List remains online, as some still use it.

(RAW)
- List.txt: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xlimit91/xlimit91-block-list/master/List.txt
- blacklist.txt: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xlimit91/xlimit91-block-list/master/blacklist.txt
- regex.list (for Pi-Hole): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xlimit91/xlimit91-block-list/master/regex.list

(HOW TO)
- If you want to add List.txt or blacklist.txt to your Pi-Hole, go to your Pi-Hole Admin Console » Settings » Blocklists » Add the link/url » click save & update button
