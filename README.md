|Listname|URL|
|--|--|
|blacklist.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xlimit91/xlimit91-block-list/master/blacklist.txt|
|regex.list|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xlimit91/xlimit91-block-list/master/regex.list|

**INFO:**

**Feel free to share it with others!** I will try to keep it up-to-date regularly.
- Added blacklist and regex.list seperately.
- (Discontinued) **List.txt** will probably not receive any new updates, or at least at longer intervals. It will stay online, because some may still use it. Please do not add it to your PiHole, use blacklist.txt and regex.list instead!
